# Prices

Simple [Electron](http://electronjs.org) application that shows the current
price of Curevac, BioNTech, and others :) using the STOOQ API. 



## Getting started

- Install [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org)
- Clone this repository
- `cd Desktop-Stock-Tracker`
- `npm install` to install the application's dependencies
- `npm start` to start the application

## Going further

Here are some ideas on how it can be improved using other Electron APIs:

- Double-click commodity to open directly on https://stooq.com
- Refresh automatically on an interval.
- Add the price of TECDAX to the app.
- Show percentage change in price.
- Show notifications when prices go above/below certain amounts.
- Show €€€€
